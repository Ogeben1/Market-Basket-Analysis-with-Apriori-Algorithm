# Market-Basket-Analysis-with-Apriori-Algorithm
This project involves performing Market Basket Analysis using the Apriori algorithm. The analysis is applied to a grocery sales dataset to discover associations between different products.

#### Description
- Whenever you visit a retail supermarket, you will find that milk, sugar and coffee, bread and butter, pizza base and cheese, chocolate, and pringles are positioned together in the store for sales. This is what market basket analysis is all about - analyzing the association of products bought together by customers.
  Market basket analysis is a versatile used case in the retail industry that helps cross-sell products in a physical outlet and also helps e-commerce businesses recommend products to customers based on product associations. Apriori and FP growth are the most popular machine learning algorithms used for association learning to perform market basket analysis.

## Overview
Market Basket analysis can provide valuable information to increase sales by better understanding customers purchasing paterns. This project aims to :
- Preprocess and analyze sales performance.
- Perform market basket analysis to understand the overall sales performance looking customers purchase behaviour.
- Determine which products are most likely bought together.
- Identifies pattern behaviour of customers.
- Visualize analysis results for product placement and up-sell tactics.
- Conduct in-depth analysis to extract insights and correlations.
